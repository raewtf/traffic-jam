# Traffic Jam
A new jammy title that took me unreasonably long to wrap up. Can't guarantee any good-practice code in here, but feel free to poke around and take what you want!

Currently unavailable for purchase (in the Catalog pipeline now!), but if you wanna try it out early... use `pdc` to build the `source/` folder, and enjoy! (Note that scoreboard functions won't work properly when building from source â€” for proper leaderboard support, please consider buying the game in Catalog!)
